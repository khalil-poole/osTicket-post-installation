Connect to the Remote Desktop and then login to osTicket as an Admin using the credentials made in the previous tutorial -> http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php

<h2>Roles, Departments, and Teams</h2>

<h3>Configure Roles (for grouping permissions)</h3>

We going to give the name of this new role as "Supreme Admin" and give it all permissions. Think of this role as the CEO of a madeup company.
